/*Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya loves tickets very much. As we know, each ticket has a number that is a positive integer. Its length equals n (n is always even). Petya calls a ticket lucky if the ticket's number is a lucky number and the sum of digits in the first half (the sum of the first n / 2 digits) equals the sum of digits in the second half (the sum of the last n / 2 digits). Check if the given ticket is lucky.

Input
The first line contains an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the length of the ticket number that needs to be checked. The second line contains an integer whose length equals exactly n — the ticket number. The number may contain leading zeros.

Output
On the first line print "YES" if the given ticket number is lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).*/
