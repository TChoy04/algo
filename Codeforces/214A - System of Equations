/*Furik loves math lessons very much, so he doesn't attend them, unlike Rubik. But now Furik wants to get a good mark for math. For that Ms. Ivanova, his math teacher, gave him a new task. Furik solved the task immediately. Can you?

You are given a system of equations:

a^2 + b = n
a + b^2 = m

You should count, how many there are pairs of integers (a, b) (0 ≤ a, b) which satisfy the system.

Input
A single line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the parameters of the system. The numbers on the line are separated by a space.

Output
On a single line print the answer to the problem. */

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int solver(int n, int m ){
	int res = 0;
	for(int a = 0; a<1000; a++){
		for(int b = 0; b<1000; b++){
			int mult1 = (a*a)+b;
			int mult2 = a+(b*b);
			if(mult1==n && mult2 ==m) res++;
			if(mult1>n || mult2>m) break;
		}
	}
	return res;
