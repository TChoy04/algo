/*There are n participants in a competition, participant i having a strength of si.

Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the other best participant. In other words, each participant i wants to know the difference between si and sj, where j is the strongest participant in the competition, not counting i (a difference can be negative).

So, they ask you for your help! For each i (1≤i≤n) output the difference between si and the maximum strength of any participant other than participant i.

Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array.

The following line contains n space-separated positive integers s1, s2, ..., sn (1≤si≤109) — the strengths of the participants.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case, output n space-separated integers. For each i (1≤i≤n) output the difference between si and the maximum strength of any other participant.*/
