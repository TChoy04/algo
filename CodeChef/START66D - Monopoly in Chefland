Problem
Chef is the financial incharge of Chefland and one of his duties is identifying if any company has gained a monopolistic advantage in the market.

There are exactly 3 companies in the market each of whose revenues are denoted by R1, R2 and R3 respectively. 
A company is said to have a monopolistic advantage if its revenue is strictly greater than the sum of the revenues of its competitors.

Given the revenue of the 33 companies, help Chef determine if any of them has a monopolistic advantage.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing three space separated integers R1, R2 and R3 denoting the revenue of the three companies respectively.
For each test case, output YES if any of the companies has a monopolistic advantage over its competitors, else output NO.*/
