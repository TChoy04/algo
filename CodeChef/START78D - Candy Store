/*Another trivial problem 
Problem
Chef has started working at the candy store. The store has 100100 chocolates in total.

Chef’s daily goal is to sell XX chocolates. For each chocolate sold, he will get 11 rupee. However, if Chef exceeds his daily goal, he gets 22 rupees per chocolate for each extra chocolate.

If Chef sells YY chocolates in a day, find the total amount he made.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers XX and YY — the daily goal of Chef, and the number of chocolates he actually sells.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the total amount Chef made in a day.
