/*Your teacher gave you an assignment — given an integer N, construct a binary string B = b1,b2,b3 of length N such that max(bi,bi+1) = 1 for every i from 1 to N-1.

What is the minimum number of 1's such a binary string can contain?

Note: A binary string is a string consisting of only the digits 0 and 1.

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer N — the length of binary string you'd like to construct.

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of 11's required to complete the assignment. */
