If you have zero moves, check and see if the starting square is the ending square
If the starting square is the ending square, check and see if t is greater than one. If it is, you can simply walk around in circles around the square until t moves is reached
Else, check to see if the target square can be reached. If it can be reached, you can simply walk around in circles if there are extra moves.
