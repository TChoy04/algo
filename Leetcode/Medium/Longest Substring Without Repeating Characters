#Messy Solution but
#Iterate through the string until a duplicate is found to find the size of sliding window.
#Use sliding window to find largest substring, use a set to keep track of the letters in the substring. Use a res variable to keep track of the maximum result.
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
#There is probably a more efficient way to do the same thing if rewritten. There is definetely a more concise solution.
